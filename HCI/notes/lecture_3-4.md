# Memory and Attention in Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)
It focuses on understanding human cognition, how our memory works, and how attention spans dictate the way we design design user interfaces.

# 1.HCI Goals and User Cognition
The primary goal of HCI is to develop or improve systems by ensuring safety, utility, effectiveness, efficiency, usability, and appeal. To achieve this, designers must understand user cognition, which is the mental process of perceiving, processing, and responding to information.

. Experiential Cognition: This involves perceiving and reacting effortlessly based on expertise, such as driving a car or reading a books.
. Reflective Cognition: This involves thinking, comparing, and decision-making that leads to new ideas, such as learning or writing a book.

# The Three Stages of Memory

Memory is not just a simple storage box; it is an active, constructive process broken into encoding, storing, and retrieving information.

1: Sensory Memory: Briefly holds input from our senses (sight, sound, touch). It acts as a temporary buffer where information is continuously overwritten within a fraction of a second.
Real-Life Example: Seeing the trailing light of a sparkler or fireworks in the night sky.

2: Short-Term/Working Memory: Holds information for a few seconds or minutes while you actively use it. It relies on a "Central Executive" to process current information, a "Visuo-spatial sketchpad" for visual/spatial info, and an "Articulatory loop" for audio. It has a limited capacity of 4 to 5 items and lasts about 20 seconds without rehearsal.
Real-Life Example: Holding a One-Time Password (OTP) in your head just long enough to type it into an app. Grouping a phone number like "051 9049 5337" (chunking) makes it easier to hold in working memory than "05190495337".

3: Long-Term Memory: Stores information for days, years, or a lifetime and has an unlimited capacity.
    . Semantic Memory: Facts and concepts, like the rules of a language.
    . Episodic Memory: Personal history, like your graduation day.
    . Procedural Memory: Learned skills that do not require conscious thought, like riding a bike or driving.
# Forgetting and Attention
Users inevitably forget things and get distracted. Designers must account for human limitations.

. why we forget: Information might decay over time, be displaced by new information, or suffer from interference. 
. Attention: Selective attention (focusing on one thing, like the "cocktail party effect") leads to better performance than divided attention (multi-tasking, like watching TV while on the phone). Attention is negatively affected by stress, noise, and high mental workload.

# HCI Design Implications for Memory

. Do not overload short-term memory: Present fewer options per screen; group menus logically.
. Favor Recognition over Recall: It is easier for users to recognize an icon or a button than to remember and type a specific command .
. Use consistent patterns: Save memory effort by using standard symbols, clear navigation markers, and not hiding core elements.
