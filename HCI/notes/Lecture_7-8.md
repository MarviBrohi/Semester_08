LECTURE 7-8: THE PACT FRAMEWORK

The PACT framework is a core concept in HCI used to analyze and design interactive systems. PACT stands for People,  Activities, Context, and Technology. The central principle is that "people use Technology to undertake Activities in Contexts". Understanding how these four elements interact helps designers create better, more user friendly systems.

# 1. People:
This element focuses on the users of the system. Every user is different, and designers must account for these variations.
# . Physical Differences: 
    This includes variations in height, weight, and the five senses, as well as ergonomics.
    . Fitts' Law: A key concept here is Fitts' Law, which states that the time it takes to move to a target depends on the distance to the target and its size. Closer and bigger targets are faster to click, while farther and smaller targets take more time.
    . Real-Life Example: It is faster to click a large "Submit" button  than a tiny text link hidden at the bottom of a page. This is why mobile apps have large buttons for essential actions like "Call" or "Send".

# . Psychological Differences:
People have varying spatial abilities, language backgrounds, and cultural norms.
# . Mental Models:
A mental model is how a user thinks a system works, which may be different from how the system actually works. Users build these models by interacting with systems and observing outcomes. If the user's mental model does not match the system's actual model, confusion occurs.
. Real-Life Example: A user's mental model might be that putting a file in the computer's "trash bin" deletes it forever. The actual system model is that it just moves the file to a temporary folder.

# 2. Activities:
This refers to the tasks users are trying to accomplish using the technology.
# Complexity and Frequency:
Tasks can range from simple to highly complex and can be performed frequently or rarely. Designers must decide if a system should be "easy to learn" (for infrequent tasks) or "easy to do" (for frequent tasks).
# Response Time:
The time a system takes to respond is critical. For instance, a cause-and-effect relationship (like clicking a button) should ideally take about one second. If it takes more than 5 seconds, users feel frustrated and confused.
# Cooperation:
Tasks can be individual or involve group cooperation, requiring communication and coordination features.
. Real-Life Example: Using an ATM to withdraw cash is a high-frequency, relatively simple, individual activity. The interface needs to be straightforward and fast.

# 3. Context:
Activities always happen in a specific context, which heavily influences how the technology should be designed.
# Physical Environment:
This includes factors like lighting and noise levels.
# Social and Organizational Context:
This involves social norms, power dynamics, and authority within an organization.
. Real-Life Example: An app designed for construction workers needs to account for the physical context: bright sunlight (requiring high contrast screens) and noisy environments (meaning audio alerts might be missed).

# 4. Technologies
This encompasses the hardware and software used to complete the activity.
# Input:
How users give commands to the system (e.g., QWERTY keyboards, single vs. multi-touch screens, sensors, buttons).
# Output:
How the system communicates back to the user (e.g., screen dimensions, resolution, projectors, printers).
. Real-Life Example: A smartwatch utilizes different technology than a desktop computer. Its input relies heavily on touch and voice, and its output is limited to a small, low-resolution screen, which drastically changes how apps must be designed for it.
