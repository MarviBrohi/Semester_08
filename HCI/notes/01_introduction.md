# Week 1-2: Introduction to HCI

# Definition of HCI:
Definition of HCI

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. It studies how people interact with computers and how systems can be designed to improve usability, efficiency, safety, and user satisfaction.
According to ACM SIGCHI (1992), HCI is concerned with designing interactive systems for human use and studying the major phenomena surrounding them.
In simple words, HCI is about making technology easy, useful, and enjoyable for humans.

# Real-Life Example
When you use WhatsApp, you do not think about programming code. You focus on sending messages easily. That ease of use is the result of good HCI.

# Different Terms Used in HCI

-HCI (Human Computer Interaction)
-CHI (Computer Human Interaction)
-MMI (Man Machine Interaction)
-HMI (Human Machine Interaction)

# Components of HCI

# 1. Human
    Single users or multiple users interacting with a system. Humans have physical, cognitive, and emotional limitations.
Example: An elderly user may need larger text and simpler navigation.
# 2. Computer
    Devices like desktop, laptop, mobile phone, ATM, microwave oven.

Example: A mobile phone interface must be different from a microwave oven interface.
# 3.Interaction
    The communication between user and system. It can be:
    .Direct interaction (touchscreen, mouse click)
    .Indirect interaction (remote control, voice assistant)

# Multidisciplinary Nature of HCI
    HCI combines knowledge from:
    Computer Science
    Psychology
    Design
    Ergonomics
    Sociology
Example: Designing a hospital system requires understanding psychology (stress), ergonomics (physical comfort), and computing (software).

# Goals of HCI
HCI has three main goals:
# 1. Useful
The system must accomplish what users need.
Example: A calculator must correctly perform calculations.
# 2. Usable
The system must be easy and natural to use.
Example: A mobile banking app should allow money transfer in simple steps.
# 3. Used
People must want to use it. It should be attractive and engaging.
Example: Instagram is not only functional but visually engaging.

# Elements of Interface Design
. Typography
The style and arrangement of text.
Example: Large headings and readable fonts improve clarity.
. Color Theory
Choosing colors that create emotion and improve readability.
Example: Red for warnings, green for success messages.
. Layout and Composition
Organizing elements for balance and structure.
Example: Navigation bar at top, content in middle, footer at bottom.
. Imagery and Icons
Using visuals to convey meaning.
Example: Trash bin icon for delete.

# Why Study HCI? (Software Perspective)
If software is difficult to use:
. Users get frustrated
. They stop using it
. Business loses customers
Example: If an e-commerce website checkout is complicated, users abandon their cart.

# Why Study HCI? (Non-Software Perspective)
HCI is not limited to software.
Examples:
. Push/Pull door confusion
. Complicated car radio controls
. Difficult-to-use microwave oven
. Bicycle design (handle, brake, seat alignment)
If these are poorly designed, users make errors or even face accidents.

# Consequences of Poor Design
If users fail multiple times:
. They lose confidence
. They stop using the product
.They switch to competitors
Example: If a mobile app crashes repeatedly, users uninstall it.
# Software Engineering vs HCI
Software Engineering focuses on:
. Correctness
. Performance
. Code quality

HCI focuses on:
. Usability
. User experience
. Ease of learning
. User satisfaction
Example: A system may be technically correct but still hard to use.

# User-Centered Design (UCD)
User-Centered Design means designing systems based on user needs rather than developer assumptions.

Steps include:
. Understanding user requirements
. Analyzing tasks
. Designing prototypes
. Testing with users
. Improving based on feedback
Example: Before building a university portal, developers interview students and teachers.

# Usability Engineering and Testing
Usability testing evaluates how easy and efficient a system is.
Methods include:
. Laboratory experiments
. Expert reviews
. User testing sessions
Example: Observing users while they complete tasks on a website.

# Human Factors and Ergonomics
Human factors study physical and psychological capabilities of users.

This includes:
. Physical comfort
. Accessibility
. Health issues
. Cognitive load
Example: Adjustable office chairs reduce back pain.
Large buttons help visually impaired users.

# Accessibility
Accessibility ensures systems can be used by people with disabilities.
Example:
. Screen readers for blind users
. High contrast mode
. Voice input systems

# Cognitive Load
. Cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to use a system.
. If too much information is presented at once, users feel overwhelmed.
Example: A cluttered dashboard with 20 buttons increases cognitive load.
Good design reduces cognitive effort.

# Plagiarism
Plagiarism means copying someone else’s work without giving proper credit.
Types include:
. Direct copying
. Paraphrasing without reference
. Collusion

# HCI Career Opportunities
HCI professionals work as:
. UX Designers
. UI Designers
. Usability Analysts
. Interaction Designers
. Product Designers
Companies value HCI experts because good user experience increases product success.
