Week 5-6: EMOTIONS AND AFFECTIVE COMPUTING

. Techolody that can recognize, understand, interpret, and respond to human emotions.
. Making computers smart enough to understand how you feel and react accordingly.

# Defining Affect: Emotion, Mood, and Sentiment
. Emotions: Immediate reactions to events. Basic emotions include fear, anger, and surprise, while long-term ones include love or jealousy.
. Moods: Less intense then emotions but long-lasting, such as besing in a good mood all day or feeling irritable.
. Sentiments: Stable emotionl attitude developed over time toward things or ideas, such as patriotism or respect for teachers.

# How emotions Influences Usability:
Our emotional state directly impacts our cognitive performance.
. As Donald Norman Notes, "Nagative effect can make it harder to do even easy tasks; positive effect can make it easier to do difficult tasks".
. When users are stressed, Problem-solving because much more difficult. Conversely, relaxed users are more forgiving of design shortcomings.

Real-Life Example: If a student submits a form and gets a vague "Error Code 504X," they feel confused and frustrated. If they get a green tick and a message saying "File uploaded successfully," they feel reassured and positive. A clear "Remember me" option with a "Show password" icon reduces anxiety and makes the user feel comfortable.

# . Psychological Theories of Emotion
Understanding how emotions are generated helps in designing affective systems:
. Basic Emotions (Universal): Fear, surprise, disgust, anger, happiness, and sadness are universally recognized.
. Facial Action Coding System (FACS): Developed by Ekman and Friesen (1978), this is the gold standard for describing facial movements based on anatomy.
. James-Lange Theory: A sequential theory stating that a physiological action precedes the emotion (e.g., Stimulus -> Physiological change -> Interpretation -> Emotion).
. Cannon-Bard Theory: A parallel theory stating that physiological changes and the experience of emotion happen at the same time following a stimulus.
. Schachter-Singer Theory: Emotion is the result of evaluating our physiological responses based heavily on the context of the situation.

# Affective Computing
Affective computing is the study of systems that can detect and respond to human emotions.

# How it works
 The system takes input (apparent signals like facial expressions or voice intonation, and less apparent signals like heart rate or blood pressure). It uses pattern recognition to extract features, uses reasoning to predict the emotion, and outputs a response.

. Challenges: The sensors required can be intrusive or awkward to wear. Furthermore, different emotions can trigger the exact same physiological signs (e.g., the physical signs for disgust and amusement can be very similar), requiring complex intelligent systems to decipher.
