# LECTURE 9-10: GESTALT PRINCIPLES OF VISUAL PERCEPTION
"Gestalt" is a German word meaaning "figure" or "shape". In HCI, Gestalt principles are theories of human visual perception that describe how we naturally organize and structure visual information. Our vision is optimized to see structure rather than just collection of disconnected parts.

# 1. Proximity:
    - Concept:objects that are close together are percieved as belonging to the same group. The relative distance between objects help us understand their organization.
    - HCi Application:Placing related items close together in an interface ensures users naturally understand they are grouped. If items are not properly grouped, it causes confusion and frustration.
    Real-Life Example: On a login screen, the "Username" field, "Password" field, and the "Login" button are placed close together. A "Forgot Password?" link is also nearby, while the site's footer links are placed far away at the bottom.
# 2. Similarity:
    - Concept:Objects that look similar in shape, size, or color appear to be grouped together.
    . Real-Life-Example: In a word processor toolbar, all formatting options(bold, italic, underline) might have the same button size and style, indicating they perform related fuction.
# 3. Continuity:
    - Concept:Human visual perception is biased toword seeing continuous forms, rather than disjointed ones, We tend to resolve ambiguity by filling in missing data to create a smooth, continuous path.
    . Real-Life-Example:In a line graph showing sales over time, even if there are gaps in the data points, our eyes naturally follow the implied line to understand the overall trens.
# 4. Closure:
    - Concept:We have an innate ability and bias to visually "close" open figures to see whole objects.
    . Real-Life-Example: The IBM logo consists of horizontal stripes,but because of closure, our brains fill in the gaps and we reas the letters clearly. Similarly, loading icons that are incomplete circles are still percieved as circles.
# 5. Symmetry:
    - Concept:We tend to parse complex scenes by looking for symmetry(balanced and equal arrangements of parts on both sides of an axis) to reduce visual complexity.
    . Real-life-Example: A well-designed webpage often uses a grid system to ensure columns of text and images are symmetrically balanced, making the page feel structured and easy to read.
# 6. Figure/Ground
    - Concept: We naturally divide our visual field into a "figure" (the foreground object we are focusing on) and the "ground" (the background). Our primary attention is on the foreground.
    . Real-Life Example: When a pop-up modal appears on a website, the rest of the site usually darkens or blurs. This forces the modal to become the "figure" and the rest of the website to become the "ground," directing your attention to the pop-up.

# 7. Common Fate:
    - Concept: This relates to the perception of moving objects. Objects that move together in the same direction or speed are perceived as a group.
    . Real-Life Example: In a file manager, if you select five different files and drag them, they all move together across the screen, and you perceive them as a single grouped action.

-Important Note: These Gestalt principles do not work in isolation; they work together in interfaces to help users navigate and understand information quickly.
